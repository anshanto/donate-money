                <h1>Other ways to donate to Caritas</h1>
                <p>Cardinal Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle, President of Caritas Internationalis, has the following message
                    for us.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We are scandalised that millions of our brothers and sisters live in extreme poverty in a world of
                    riches. Yet we are filled with hope because we are the first generation with the means to liberate
                    them.</p>
                <br>

                <p>The Church has worked for and alongside the poorest people in the world throughout its history. Pope
                    Francis has reinforced our mission. He chose his name after St. Francis of Assisi, a symbol of
                    peace, austerity and poverty.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Caritas follows in the tradition of St. Francis in providing care to those who are excluded and
                    marginalised.</p>
